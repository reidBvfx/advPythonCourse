Often shots will require a hand or other object to interact with a simmed cloth/fur that either moves too fast or does not have a high enough resolution to be accurate when running a sim. i.e a hand running through a dogâ€™s fur or a person touching the chest of a person in wet clothes. I would look at creating a tool that creates a brush that allows moveable, keyable deformations without the need for actual ncloth simming.
